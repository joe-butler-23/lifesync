 * We have wrong pos information stored in the blocks some times. Don't know the root cause.
 * It causes many operations to behave in the wrong way. E.g. Dedent a child of an item with wrong pos causes the child item to move in an unpredictable manner.
 * move-up and move-down also start working weirdly.
 * So we sanitize or correct the pos information before we render anything.
 * The next time this data is saved, it's alright.
